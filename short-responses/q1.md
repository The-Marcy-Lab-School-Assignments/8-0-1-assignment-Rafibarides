# Question

What makes a middleware function different from a normal controller?

# Answer
Controllers send data back that we can see in the browser. Middleware does not send a response back.

The main goal of middleware is to prepare, inspect, or alter the request/response objects before they reach the controller, or to finalize the response after the controller has done its job. Controllers, on the other hand, are primarily concerned with handling business logic. After the middleware has prepared the request, the controller takes over to process that request based on the application's business rules. It decides what the response will be, such as rendering a view, returning JSON data, etc. Middleware is like the security staff at an event. When a guest arrives (an HTTP request is made), the security team checks the guest's invitation (request parsing), makes sure the guest knows where they are going (routing), and might give them a badge or wristband (adding information to the request). The guest is then allowed to proceed to the main event (the controller action), which decides the final outcome of the request.
